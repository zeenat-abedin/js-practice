// Write a function to flatten a multi-dimensional array into a single-level array.
// Provide both recursive and iterative solutions.

// The problem involves transforming an array that contains nested arrays of various levels into a single-level array. For example, given an input like [[1, 2, [3]], 4].
// The expected output would be [1, 2, 3, 4]

function flattenArray(value) {
