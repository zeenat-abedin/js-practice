/*
You are given an array of objects, where each object represents a user
with a name and a score. Your task is to complete the
getUsersByScore function. This function should take two arguments:
    data: An array of user objects (see the example data array below).
    scoreAbove: A number representing the minimum score.

The function should return a new array containing only the user objects
whose score is strictly greater than scoreAbove.
